# Game of Throwns

## Input 

Consists of two lines. The first line contains two positive integers nn kk ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, 1≤k≤1001≤k≤100) indicating the number of students and how many throw commands Daenerys calls out, respectively. The following line contains the kk throw commands. Each command is either an integer pp (−10 000≤p≤10 000−10000≤p≤10000) indicating how many positions to throw the egg clockwise or undo mm (m≥1m≥1) indicating that the last mm throws should be undone. Daenerys never has the kids undo beyond the start of the game.

## Output

Display the number of the child with the egg at the end of the game.
